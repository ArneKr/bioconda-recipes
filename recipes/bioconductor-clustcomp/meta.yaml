  summary: 'clustComp is a package that implements several techniques for the comparison
    and visualisation of relationships between different clustering results, either
    flat versus flat or hierarchical versus flat. These relationships among clusters
    are displayed using a weighted bi-graph, in which the nodes represent the clusters
    and the edges connect pairs of nodes with non-empty intersection; the weight of
    each edge is the number of elements in that intersection and is displayed through
    the edge thickness. The best layout of the bi-graph is provided by the barycentre
    algorithm, which minimises the weighted number of crossings. In the case of comparing
    a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical clustering, the dendrogram is pruned at
    different heights, selected by exploring the tree by depth-first search, starting
    at the root. Branches are decided to be split according to the value of a scoring
    function, that can be based either on the aesthetics of the bi-graph or on the
    mutual information between the hierarchical and the flat clusterings. A mapping
    between groups of clusters from each side is constructed with a greedy algorithm,
    and can be additionally visualised.'
