  summary: 'The CCREPE (Compositionality Corrected by REnormalizaion and PErmutation)
    package is designed to assess the significance of general similarity measures
    in compositional datasets.  In microbial abundance data, for example, the total
    abundances of all microbes sum to one; CCREPE is designed to take this constraint
    into account when assigning p-values to similarity measures between the microbes.  The
    package has two functions: ccrepe:    Calculates similarity measures, p-values
    and q-values for relative abundances of bugs in one or two body sites using bootstrap
    and permutation matrices of the data. nc.score:  Calculates species-level co-variation
    and co-exclusion patterns based on an extension of the checkerboard score to ordinal
    data.'
