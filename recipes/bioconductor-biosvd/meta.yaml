  summary: 'The biosvd package contains functions to reduce the input data set from
    the feature x assay space to the reduced diagonalized eigenfeature x eigenassay
    space, with the eigenfeatures and eigenassays unique orthonormal superpositions
    of the features and assays, respectively. Results of SVD applied to the data can
    subsequently be inspected based on generated graphs, such as a heatmap of the
    eigenfeature x assay matrix and a bar plot with the eigenexpression fractions
    of all eigenfeatures. These graphs aid in deciding which eigenfeatures and eigenassays
    to filter out (i.e., eigenfeatures representing steady state, noise, or experimental
    artifacts; or when applied to the variance in the data, eigenfeatures representing
    steady-scale variance). After possible removal of steady state expression, steady-scale
    variance, noise and experimental artifacts, and after re-applying SVD to the normalized
    data, a summary html report of the eigensystem is generated, containing among
    others polar plots of the assays and features, a table with the list of features
    sortable according to their coordinates, radius and phase in the polar plot, and
    a visualization of the data sorted according to the two selected eigenfeatures
    and eigenassays with colored feature/assay annotation information when provided.
    This gives a global picture of the dynamics of expression/intensity levels, in
    which individual features and assays are classified in groups of similar regulation
    and function or similar cellular state and biological phenotype.'
