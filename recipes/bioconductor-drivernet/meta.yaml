  summary: 'DriverNet is a package to predict functional important driver genes in
    cancer by integrating genome data (mutation and copy number variation data) and
    transcriptome data (gene expression data). The different kinds of data are combined
    by an influence graph, which is a gene-gene interaction network deduced from pathway
    data. A greedy algorithm is used to find the possible driver genes, which may
    mutated in a larger number of patients and these mutations will push the gene
    expression values of the connected genes to some extreme values.'
