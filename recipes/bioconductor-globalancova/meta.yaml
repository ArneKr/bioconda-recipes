  summary: 'We give the following arguments in support of the GlobalAncova approach:
    After appropriate normalisation, gene-expression-data appear rather symmetrical
    and outliers are no real problem, so least squares should be rather robust. ANCOVA
    with interaction yields saturated data modelling e.g. different means per group
    and gene. Covariate adjustment can help to correct for possible selection bias.
    Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application
    of ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken).
    Therefore, using the classical F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The
    test statistic however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination
    with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can be approximated.
    Alternatively, an approximation yields asymptotic p-values. This work was supported
    by the NGFN grant 01 GR 0459, BMBF, Germany.'
