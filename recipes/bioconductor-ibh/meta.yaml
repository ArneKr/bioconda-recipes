  summary: 'This package contains methods for calculating Interaction Based Homogeneity
    to evaluate fitness of gene lists to an interaction network which is useful for
    evaluation of clustering results and gene list analysis. BioGRID interactions
    are used in the calculation. The user can also provide their own interactions.'
