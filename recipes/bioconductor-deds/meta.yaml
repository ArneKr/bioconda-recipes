  summary: 'This library contains functions that calculate various statistics of differential
    expression for microarray data, including t statistics, fold change, F statistics,
    SAM, moderated t and F statistics and B statistics. It also implements a new methodology
    called DEDS (Differential Expression via Distance Summary), which selects differentially
    expressed genes by integrating and summarizing a set of statistics using a weighted
    distance approach.'
