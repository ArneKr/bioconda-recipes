  summary: 'Two options are added to the LPE algorithm. The original LPE method sets
    all variances below the max variance in the ordered distribution of variances
    to the maximum variance. in LPEadj this option is turned off by default.  The
    second option is to use a variance adjustment based on sample size rather than
    pi/2.  By default the LPEadj uses the sample size based variance adjustment.'
