  summary: 'Genomic data analyses requires integrated visualization of known genomic
    information and new experimental data.  GenomeGraphs uses the biomaRt package
    to perform live annotation queries to Ensembl and translates this to e.g. gene/transcript
    structures in viewports of the grid graphics package. This results in genomic
    information plotted together with your data.  Another strength of GenomeGraphs
    is to plot different data types such as array CGH, gene expression, sequencing
    and other data, together in one plot using the same genome coordinate system.'
