  summary: 'Package blima includes several algorithms for the preprocessing of Illumina
    microarray data. It focuses to the bead level analysis and provides novel approach
    to the quantile normalization of the vectors of unequal lengths. It provides variety
    of the methods for background correction including background subtraction, RMA
    like convolution and background outlier removal. It also implements variance stabilizing
    transformation on the bead level. There are also implemented methods for data
    summarization. It also provides the methods for performing T-tests on the detector
    (bead) level and on the probe level for differential expression testing.'
