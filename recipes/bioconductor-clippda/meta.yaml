  summary: 'Methods for the nalysis of data from clinical proteomic profiling studies.
    The focus is on the studies of human subjects, which are often observational case-control
    by design and have technical replicates. A method for sample size determination
    for planning these studies is proposed. It incorporates routines for adjusting
    for the expected heterogeneities and imbalances in the data and the within-sample
    replicate correlations.'
