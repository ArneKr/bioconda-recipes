  summary: 'cogena is a workflow for co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis. It
    aims to discovery smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may
    be of great biological relevance. A novel pipeline for drug discovery and drug
    repositioning based on the cogena workflow is proposed. Particularly, candidate
    drugs can be predicted based on the gene expression of disease-related data, or
    other similar drugs can be identified based on the gene expression of drug-related
    data. Moreover, the drug mode of action can be disclosed by the associated pathway
    analysis. In summary, cogena is a flexible workflow for various gene set enrichment
    analysis for co-expressed genes, with a focus on pathway/GO analysis and drug
    repositioning.'
