  summary: 'The GENESIS package provides methodology for estimating, inferring, and
    accounting for population and pedigree structure in genetic analyses.  The current
    implementation provides functions to perform PC-AiR (Conomos et al., 2015, Gen
    Epi) and PC-Relate (Conomos et al., 2016, AJHG). PC-AiR performs a Principal Components
    Analysis on genome-wide SNP data for the detection of population structure in
    a sample that may contain known or cryptic relatedness. Unlike standard PCA, PC-AiR
    accounts for relatedness in the sample to provide accurate ancestry inference
    that is not confounded by family structure. PC-Relate uses ancestry representative
    principal components to adjust for population structure/ancestry and accurately
    estimate measures of recent genetic relatedness such as kinship coefficients,
    IBD sharing probabilities, and inbreeding coefficients. Additionally, functions
    are provided to perform efficient variance component estimation and mixed model
    association testing for both quantitative and binary phenotypes.'
