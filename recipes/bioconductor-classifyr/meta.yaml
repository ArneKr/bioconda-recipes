  summary: 'The software formalises a framework for classification in R. There are
    four stages; Data transformation, feature selection, classifier training, and
    prediction. The requirements of variable types and names are fixed, but specialised
    variables for functions can also be provided. The classification framework is
    wrapped in a driver loop, that reproducibly carries out a number of cross-validation
    schemes. Functions for differential expression, differential variability, and
    differential distribution are included. Additional functions may be developed
    by the user, by creating an interface to the framework.'
