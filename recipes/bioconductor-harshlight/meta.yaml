  summary: 'The package is used to detect extended, diffuse and compact blemishes
    on microarray chips. Harshlight automatically marks the areas in a collection
    of chips (affybatch objects) and a corrected AffyBatch object is returned, in
    which the defected areas are substituted with NAs or the median of the values
    of the same probe in the other chips in the collection. The new version handle
    the substitute value as whole matrix to solve the memory problem.'
