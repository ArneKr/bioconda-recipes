  summary: 'Fast functions for bipartite network rewiring through N consecutive switching
    steps (See References) and for the computation of the minimal number of switching
    steps to be performed in order to maximise the dissimilarity with respect to the
    original network. Includes functions for the analysis of the introduced randomness
    across the switching steps and several other routines to analyse the resulting
    networks and their natural projections. Extension to undirected networks and directed
    signed networks is also provided. Starting from version 1.9.7 a more precise bound
    (especially for small network) has been implemented. Starting from version 2.2.0
    the analysis routine is more complete and a visual montioring of the underlying
    Markov Chain has been implemented. Starting from 3.6.0 the library can handle
    also matrices with NA (not for the directed signed graphs).'
