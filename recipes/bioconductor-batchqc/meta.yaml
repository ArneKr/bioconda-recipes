  summary: 'Sequencing and microarray samples often are collected or processed in
    multiple batches or at different times. This often produces technical biases that
    can lead to incorrect results in the downstream analysis. BatchQC is a software
    tool that streamlines batch preprocessing and evaluation by providing interactive
    diagnostics, visualizations, and statistical analyses to explore the extent to
    which batch variation impacts the data. BatchQC diagnostics help determine whether
    batch adjustment needs to be done, and how correction should be applied before
    proceeding with a downstream analysis. Moreover, BatchQC interactively applies
    multiple common batch effect approaches to the data, and the user can quickly
    see the benefits of each method. BatchQC is developed as a Shiny App. The output
    is organized into multiple tabs, and each tab features an important part of the
    batch effect analysis and visualization of the data. The BatchQC interface has
    the following analysis groups: Summary, Differential Expression, Median Correlations,
    Heatmaps, Circular Dendrogram, PCA Analysis, Shape, ComBat and SVA.'
