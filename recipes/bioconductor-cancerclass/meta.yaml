  summary: 'The classification protocol starts with a feature selection step and continues
    with nearest-centroid classification. The accurarcy of the predictor can be evaluated
    using training and test set validation, leave-one-out cross-validation or in a
    multiple random validation protocol. Methods for calculation and visualization
    of continuous prediction scores allow to balance sensitivity and specificity and
    define a cutoff value according to clinical requirements.'
