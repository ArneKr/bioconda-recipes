  summary: Variable selection from random forests using both backwards variable elimination (for
    the selection of small sets of non-redundant variables) and selection based on the
    importance spectrum (somewhat similar to scree plots; for the selection of large,
    potentially highly-correlated variables). Main applications in high-dimensional
    data (e.g., microarray data, and other genomics and proteomics applications).
