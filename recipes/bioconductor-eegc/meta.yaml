  summary: 'This package has been developed to evaluate cellular engineering processes
    for direct differentiation of stem cells or conversion (transdifferentiation)
    of somatic cells to primary cells based on high throughput gene expression data
    screened either by DNA microarray or RNA sequencing. The package takes gene expression
    profiles as inputs from three types of samples: (i) somatic or stem cells to be
    (trans)differentiated (input of the engineering process), (ii) induced cells to
    be evaluated (output of the engineering process) and (iii) target primary cells
    (reference for the output). The package performs differential gene expression
    analysis for each pair-wise sample comparison to identify and evaluate the transcriptional
    differences among the 3 types of samples (input, output, reference). The ideal
    goal is to have induced and primary reference cell showing overlapping profiles,
    both very different from the original cells.'
