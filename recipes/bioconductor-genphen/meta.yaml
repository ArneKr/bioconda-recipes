  summary: 'Genetic association studies have become an essential tool for studying
    the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes. They are necessary for the
    discovery of disease-causing genetic variants. Here we provide a tool for conducting
    genetic association studies, which uses statistical learning techniques such as
    random forests and support vector machines, as well as using Bayesian inference
    with Bayesian hierarchical models. These techniques are superior to the commonly
    used (frequentist) statistical approaches, alleviating the multiple hypothesis
    problems and the need for P value corrections, which often lead to massive numbers
    of false negatives. Thus, with genphen we provide a framework to compare the results
    obtained using frequentist methods with those obtained using the more sophisticated
    methods provided by this tool. The tool also provides a few visualization functions
    which enable the user to inspect the results of such genetic association study
    and conveniently select the genotypes which have the highest strength of association
    with the phenotype.'
