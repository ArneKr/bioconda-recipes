  summary: 'Biclustering by "Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition" (FABIA). FABIA
    is a model-based technique for biclustering, that is clustering rows and columns
    simultaneously. Biclusters are found by factor analysis where both the factors
    and the loading matrix are sparse. FABIA is a multiplicative model that extracts
    linear dependencies between samples and feature patterns. It captures realistic
    non-Gaussian data distributions with heavy tails as observed in gene expression
    measurements. FABIA utilizes well understood model selection techniques like the
    EM algorithm and variational approaches and is embedded into a Bayesian framework.
    FABIA ranks biclusters according to their information content and separates spurious
    biclusters from true biclusters. The code is written in C.'
