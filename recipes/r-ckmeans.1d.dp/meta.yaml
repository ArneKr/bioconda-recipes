  summary: A fast dynamic programming algorithmic framework to achieve optimal univariate k-means,
    k-median, and k-segments clustering. Minimizing the sum of respective within-cluster
    distances, the algorithms guarantee optimality and reproducibility. Their advantage
    over heuristic clustering algorithms in efficiency and accuracy is increasingly
    pronounced as the number of clusters k increases. Weighted k-means and unweighted
    k-segments algorithms can also optimally segment time series and perform peak calling.
    An auxiliary function generates histograms that are adaptive to patterns in data.
    This package provides a powerful alternative to heuristic methods for univariate
    data analysis.
