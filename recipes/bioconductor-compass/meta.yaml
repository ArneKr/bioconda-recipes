  summary: 'COMPASS is a statistical framework that enables unbiased analysis of antigen-specific
    T-cell subsets. COMPASS uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework to model all observed
    cell-subsets and select the most likely to be antigen-specific while regularizing
    the small cell counts that often arise in multi-parameter space. The model provides
    a posterior probability of specificity for each cell subset and each sample, which
    can be used to profile a subject''s immune response to external stimuli such as
    infection or vaccination.'
