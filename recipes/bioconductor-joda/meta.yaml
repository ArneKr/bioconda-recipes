  summary: 'Package ''joda'' implements three steps of an algorithm called JODA. The
    algorithm computes gene deregulation scores. For each gene, its deregulation score
    reflects how strongly an effect of a certain regulator''s perturbation on this
    gene differs between two different cell populations. The algorithm utilizes regulator
    knockdown expression data as well as knowledge about signaling pathways in which
    the regulators are involved (formalized in a simple matrix model).'
