  summary: 'Director is an R package designed to streamline the visualization of molecular
    effects in regulatory cascades. It utilizes the R package htmltools and a modified
    Sankey plugin of the JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast and easy, browser-enabled
    solution to discovering potentially interesting downstream effects of regulatory
    and/or co-expressed molecules. The diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged
    as highly-portable HTML files that eliminate the need for third-party software
    to view. This enables a straightforward approach for scientists to interpret the
    data produced, and bioinformatics developers an alternative means to present relevant
    data.'
