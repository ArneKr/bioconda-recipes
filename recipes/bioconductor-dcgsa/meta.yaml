  summary: 'Distance-correlation based Gene Set Analysis for longitudinal gene expression
    profiles. In longitudinal studies, the gene expression profiles were collected
    at each visit from each subject and hence there are multiple measurements of the
    gene expression profiles for each subject. The dcGSA package could be used to
    assess the associations between gene sets and clinical outcomes of interest by
    fully taking advantage of the longitudinal nature of both the gene expression
    profiles and clinical outcomes.'
