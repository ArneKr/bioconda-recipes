  summary: 'Ion fragmentation provides structural information for metabolite identification.
    This package provides utility functions to manage and analyse MS2/MS3 fragmentation
    data from ion trap mass spectrometry. It was designed for high throughput metabolomics
    data with many biological samples and a large numer of ion trees collected. Tests
    have been done with data from low-resolution mass spectrometry but could be readily
    extended to precursor ion based fragmentation data from high resoultion mass spectrometry.'
