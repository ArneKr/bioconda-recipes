  summary: 'This package allows to work with mixed omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics,
    microarray-chips, rna-seq data), introducing the following improvements: distance
    options (for numeric and/or categorical variables) for each of the tables, bootstrap
    resampling techniques on the residuals matrices for all methods, that enable perform
    confidence ellipses for the projection of individuals, variables and biplot methodology
    to project variables (gene expression) on the compromise. Since the main purpose
    of the package is to use these techniques to omic data analysis, it includes an
    example data from four different microarray platforms (i.e.,Agilent, Affymetrix
    HGU 95, Affymetrix HGU 133 and Affymetrix HGU 133plus 2.0) on the NCI-60 cell
    lines.NCI60_4arrays is a list containing the NCI-60 microarray data with only
    few hundreds of genes randomly selected in each platform to keep the size of the
    package small. The data are the same that the package omicade4 used to implement
    the co-inertia analysis. The references in packages follow the style of the APA-6th
    norm.'
