  summary: 'The term ''GeneSelector'' refers to a filter selecting those genes which
    are consistently identified as differentially expressed using various statistical
    procedures. ''Selected'' genes are those present at the top of the list in various
    ranking methods (currently 14). In addition, the stability of the findings can
    be taken into account in the final ranking by examining perturbed versions of
    the original data set, e.g. by leaving samples, swapping class labels, generating
    bootstrap replicates or adding noise. Given multiple ranked lists, one can use
    aggregation methods in order to find a synthesis.'
