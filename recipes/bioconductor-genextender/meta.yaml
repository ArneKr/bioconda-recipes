  summary: 'geneXtendeR is designed to optimally annotate a histone modification ChIP-seq
    peak input file with functionally important genomic features (e.g., genes associated
    with peaks) based on optimization calculations.  geneXtendeR optimally extends
    the boundaries of every gene in a genome by some genomic distance (in DNA base
    pairs) for the purpose of flexibly incorporating cis-regulatory elements (CREs),
    such as enhancers and promoters, as well as downstream elements that are important
    to the function of the gene relative to an epigenetic histone modification ChIP-seq
    dataset. geneXtender computes optimal gene extensions tailored to the broadness
    of the specific epigenetic mark (e.g., H3K9me1, H3K27me3), as determined by a
    user-supplied ChIP-seq peak input file. As such, geneXtender maximizes the signal-to-noise
    ratio of locating genes closest to and directly under peaks. By performing a computational
    expansion of this nature, ChIP-seq reads that would initially not map strictly
    to a specific gene can now be optimally mapped to the regulatory regions of the
    gene, thereby implicating the gene as a potential candidate, and thereby making
    the ChIP-seq experiment more successful. Such an approach becomes particularly
    important when working with epigenetic histone modifications that have inherently
    broad peaks.'
