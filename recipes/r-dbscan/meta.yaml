  summary: A fast reimplementation of several density-based algorithms of the DBSCAN family for
    spatial data. Includes the DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications
    with noise) and OPTICS (ordering points to identify the clustering structure) clustering
    algorithms HDBSCAN (hierarchical DBSCAN) and the LOF (local outlier factor) algorithm.
    The implementations uses the kd-tree data structure (from library ANN) for faster
    k-nearest neighbor search. An R interface to fast kNN and fixed-radius NN search
    is also provided.
