  summary: 'Many two-colour hybridizations suffer from a dye bias that is both gene-specific
    and slide-specific. The former depends on the content of the nucleotide used for
    labeling; the latter depends on the labeling percentage. The slide-dependency
    was hitherto not recognized, and made addressing the artefact impossible.  Given
    a reasonable number of dye-swapped pairs of hybridizations, or of same vs. same
    hybridizations, both the gene- and slide-biases can be estimated and corrected
    using the GASSCO method (Margaritis et al., Mol. Sys. Biol. 5:266 (2009), doi:10.1038/msb.2009.21)'
