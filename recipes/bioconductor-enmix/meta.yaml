  summary: 'The ENmix package provides a set of quality control and data pre-processing
    tools for Illumina HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC Beadchips. It includes
    ENmix background correction, RELIC dye bias correction, RCP probe-type bias adjustment,
    along with a number of additional tools. These functions can be used to remove
    unwanted experimental noise and thus to improve accuracy and reproducibility of
    methylation measures. ENmix functions are flexible and transparent. Users have
    option to choose a single pipeline command to finish all data pre-processing steps
    (including background correction, dye-bias adjustment, inter-array normalization
    and probe-type bias correction) or to use individual functions sequentially to
    perform data pre-processing in a more customized manner. In addition the ENmix
    package has selectable complementary functions for efficient data visualization
    (such as data distribution plots); quality control (identifing and filtering low
    quality data points, samples, probes, and outliers, along with imputation of missing
    values); identification of probes with multimodal distributions due to SNPs or
    other factors; exploration of data variance structure using principal component
    regression analysis plot; preparation of experimental factors related surrogate
    control variables to be adjusted in downstream statistical analysis; and an efficient
    algorithm oxBS-MLE to estimate 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine level.'
