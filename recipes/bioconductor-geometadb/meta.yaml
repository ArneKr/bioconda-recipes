  summary: 'The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) represents the largest public repository
    of microarray data. However, finding data of interest can be challenging using
    current tools. GEOmetadb is an attempt to make access to the metadata associated
    with samples, platforms, and datasets much more feasible. This is accomplished
    by parsing all the NCBI GEO metadata into a SQLite database that can be stored
    and queried locally. GEOmetadb is simply a thin wrapper around the SQLite database
    along with associated documentation. Finally, the SQLite database is updated regularly
    as new data is added to GEO and can be downloaded at will for the most up-to-date
    metadata. GEOmetadb paper: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/24/23/2798
