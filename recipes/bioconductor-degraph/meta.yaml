  summary: 'DEGraph implements recent hypothesis testing methods which directly assess
    whether a particular gene network is differentially expressed between two conditions.
    This is to be contrasted with the more classical two-step approaches which first
    test individual genes, then test gene sets for enrichment in differentially expressed
    genes. These recent methods take into account the topology of the network to yield
    more powerful detection procedures. DEGraph provides methods to easily test all
    KEGG pathways for differential expression on any gene expression data set and
    tools to visualize the results.'
